# ResNet50 Exploration
Here I implement ResNet50 from scratch along with YOLO. ResNet to inspect techniques like batch normalization, train and test augmentation, a few initialization methods, weight decay, etc. YOLO really just to get over the fuss.

Some interesting observations are collected in the notebook "interesting_observations.ipynb"
